#Five agile principles that should guide you every time you write code.

##(Examples are written in PHP)

##**SRP	The Single Responsibility Principle**
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

##**OCP	The Open Closed Principle**
You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.

##**LSP	The Liskov Substitution Principle**
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

##**ISP	The Interface Segregation Principle**
Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.

##**DIP	The Dependency Inversion Principle**
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
